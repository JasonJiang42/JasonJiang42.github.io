I'm a PhD graduate from the University of Hong Kong. My research interests focus on microbial genomics, including One Health, bacterial evolution, and clinical microbiology.

I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ho Pak Leung](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=0FWUuOkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Huiluo Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AP7KbY0AAAAJ&hl=en) from the Department of Microbiology.

Research interests
======
My research journey is deeply rooted in microbial genomics, especially unraveling the intricate world of bacterial genomes and the urgent challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). I'm a strong advocate for the 'One Health' approach, which means I meticulously track how antibiotic resistance genes move across different environments and hosts – from animals and humans to our food supply and the broader environment. It's like following a complex, invisible network to understand the 'how' and 'why' of their spread. It's not just about lab work for me. My work extends directly into clinical microbiology, thanks to invaluable collaborations with several Chinese hospitals. There, I get to expertly integrate real-world clinical data, allowing me to uncover the hidden genomic patterns that drive infections.

Beyond One Health and clinical microbiology, another major passion of mine within microbial genomics is unraveling the mysteries of bacterial evolution. I love tracing how bacterial lineages shift and spread across time and space, understanding the fascinating process of horizontal gene transfer and plasmid dynamics in ecological niches.

Looking ahead, I'm incredibly excited about diving into phage studies – exploring these fascinating viruses as potential tools against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. I'm also keen to investigate the specific genomic and virulence traits that enable bacteria to adapt to their hosts, with a particular focus on strains isolated from infants.
