I'm a PhD graduate from the University of Hong Kong. My research interests include antimicrobial resistance, horizontal gene transfer, One Health, microbial genomics, and Outbreak investigation.

I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ho Pak Leung](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=0FWUuOkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Huiluo Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AP7KbY0AAAAJ&hl=en) from department of Microbiology.

I'm always happy to hear from researchers with an interest in microbial genomics or other research themes related to our work. Please reach out via email: jason17@connect.hku.hk.

Research interests
======
My primary research focus is on microbial genomics, particularly bacterial genomics and antimicrobial resistance. I conduct One Health surveillance to study the transmission of antibiotic resistance genes across different hosts—including animals, humans, food, and the environment—and investigate the potential drivers of ARG dissemination. Additionally, I explore clinical microbiology and epidemiology to provide further insights for clinical decision-making.
